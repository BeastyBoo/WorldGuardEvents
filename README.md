# WorldGuardEvents
A rip-off from the original WorldGuardEvents which works with legacy versions of WorldGuard and WorldEdit (1.12.2). Original Creator: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldguardevents.66922/

NOTE: For this to work, you absolutely need both WorldEdit and WorldGuard. This is because, while creating it, I discovered that WorldGuard uses classes from WorldEdit (Especially the Vector class), which did not get shaded itself into the worldguard version.
